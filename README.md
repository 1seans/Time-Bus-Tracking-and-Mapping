# Time-Bus-Tracking-and-Mapping
## A map application using the Mapbox GL JS library that moves a marker along a predetermined route.

How to Run:
To run this project, include the Mapbox GL JS library and this code in your HTML file. You will also need to specify a valid Mapbox access token. The map will be displayed in an element with the ID map, and the marker will be moved along the route defined by the coordinates in the busStops array.

Roadmap of future improvements:
There are several potential improvements that could be made to this project in the future. For example, the route could be made dynamic and user-customizable, or additional features such as pop-ups or overlays could be added to the map. The marker could also be made more interactive, for example by allowing the user to click on it to view more information.

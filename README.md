# Time-Bus-Tracking-and-Mapping
using the Mapbox GL JS library to create a map and move a marker along a predetermined route represented by a list of coordinates stored in the busStops array. A Mapbox access token is specified and a new map is created and displayed in an element with the ID map. A marker is then added to the map at the first coordinates in the busStops array. A move function is defined that updates the marker's position every 1000 milliseconds (1 second) by setting its coordinates to the next set of coordinates in the busStops array. The function also increments a counter variable to keep track of the current position in the array. The move function is called once at the end of the code, which will start the process of moving the marker along the route. The code also includes an export statement that makes the move function available for use in other modules.
